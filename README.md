## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Flex Grid

### What I learned

This is the first time I used CSS grid and it worked perfectly. I used CSS grid on the wrapper class to put both elements (img and text-box) next to each other 

```css
.wrapper {
  background-color: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  border-radius: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin: 2rem;
}
```

```

```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on advanced CSS - including CSS grid layout and CSS flexbox layout. There is so much to learn and I want to continue focusing on all CSS capabilities and design.
